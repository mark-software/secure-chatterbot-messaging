# Secure ChatterBot Messaging (Internet Computing project)

### Project date: Fall 2014

This code is from my 2014 `Internet Computing class`. 
The assignment was to create a project that used a web service/backend.
**This repository contains only Java files for my contributions to the project.** 
The project does not contain Android UI code.

Project proposal description:
`
We would build a web app that would use the Chatter Bot API and an Android app that communicates with the AI web app via a web service. Basically, it would be an app where you can send a message to the web app and it will have a conversation with you similar to cleverbot. The Android app would communicate with the web service using GET requests and responses would be returned as JSON. The web app/service could be built with Google App Engine. The Android app UI would be similar to the default SMS app. This would be very relevant since we would be creating a web app, web service, and an Android app to communicate with it. We can even use different personalities for the responses.

### My contribution:
I wrote all the code related to cryptography _as I was highly interested in security_.
This includes all the backend code and the client code used to interact with the backend (all the code in this repository).


### My partner's contribution:
My partner wrote the Android UI.
